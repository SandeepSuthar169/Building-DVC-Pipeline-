## Building a DVC Pipeline Project

build a data version control (DVC) pipeline for machine learning workflows. The project implements a complete ML pipeline using DVC to manage data versioning, pipeline stages, and experiment tracking.

Key features of this project:

- Implements data version control using DVC

- Creates reproducible ML pipelines

- Tracks experiments and model versions

- Manages dependencies between pipeline stages

- Demonstrates integration with Git for version control

- Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages

The project serves as a template for implementing DVC in ML projects, showing best practices for data and model versioning, pipeline automation, and experiment reproducibility.

### How to Use
- Clone the repository

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run the pipeline: `dvc repro`

- Track changes: `dvc push (if using remote storage)`

The pipeline consists of three stages:

- Data preprocessing `(preprocess.py)`

- Model training `(train.py)`

- Model evaluation `(evaluate.py)`


### Pipeline Stages
 The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. data_preprocessing: `Cleans and prepares raw data`

2. feature_engineering: `Creates features for modeling`

3. model_training: `Trains machine learning models`

4. evaluation: `Evaluates model performance`


Each stage is versioned with DVC, allowing for complete reproducibility of the ML workflow.
